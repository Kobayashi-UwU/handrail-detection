# Handrail Detection

![Project Image or Logo](url_to_project_image_or_logo.png)

**Handrail Detection** is an innovative project aimed at promoting safe escalator usage. This real-time camera-based system detects whether individuals using escalators are grabbing the handrail for added safety. The project is designed to enhance public safety by encouraging handrail usage, thereby reducing the risk of accidents and injuries on escalators.

## Motivation

Escalator safety is a critical concern in public spaces, and encouraging passengers to use handrails is an important aspect of mitigating accidents. This project was inspired by the need to provide a technological solution for monitoring and promoting handrail usage in real time to any camera.

## Features

- Real-time handrail detection using computer vision.
- Automatic notification or alert if passengers do not grab the handrail.
- (Too lazy to do this) User-friendly interface for escalator operators and maintenance personnel.
- Data collection and analysis for escalator safety statistics.

## Getting Started

(On process) use pre-trained model to detect humen and transfer learning to create handrail grabbing detection, I think
